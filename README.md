# mfcode jupyterhub default

This repo is the suggested default environment for Max Fordham's Engineers 
to develop custom Notebooks and python Apps for Engineering Automation. 

The environment includes many external packages as well as internally developed
packages that facilitate and support the development of new tools. 

In the root of the repo, there are also a handful of tutorial notebooks that aim to 
demonstrate to new users how Jupyter Notebooks work, the basics of python coding, and 
showcase some packages for data-visualisation and development of user-interfaces. The 
Notebooks in these folders can be executed interactively. __Note__. changes you make to
the tutorial notebooks will not be saved into the next session. 


In the root you will find:
